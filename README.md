# NFL25

This is a Kaggle Competition, where contestants use Next Gen Stats player tracking data to generate actionable, creative, and novel stats. Previous iterations have analyzed running backs, defensive backs, special teams, pass rush plays, and tackling, and have generated metrics that have been used on television and by NFL teams.

This year's competition turns to a new type of data -- what happens before the snap -- to generate creative insights and actionable predictions into what the offense or defense does after the snap.

There are thirteen data files that can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2025/data
The files are too heavy to be included on this remote repository, so download them to your local machine or use them directly on kaggle
